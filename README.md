# Bank Services Simulation

## Project Overview

This project simulates customer service processes at a bank, providing insights into operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. The simulation models customer arrival, service times, waiting times, and queue lengths to analyze how these factors impact overall service delivery.

## Key Features

- **Customer Arrival**: Generates random inter-arrival times (IAT) for customers.
- **Service Time**: Simulates service times using random values.
- **Metrics Calculation**: Evaluates critical performance metrics such as average waiting time, maximum queue length, and server idleness.

## Results

In a single run of the simulation, the following metrics were observed:

- **Average Waiting Time**: 125.4 seconds
- **Maximum Queue Length**: 40 customers
- **Server Idle Percentage**: 0.809062%
- **Probability of Customer Waiting**: 0.99
- **Average Waiting Time for Those Who Waited**: 126.667 seconds

*Note: These values were based on randomly generated numbers and will vary with each execution of the program.*

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)
